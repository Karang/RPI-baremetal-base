# RPI-baremetal-base
A baremetal base project for the raspberry pi 2/3 that already have some peripherals available.

Use make to compile, you will need a gcc arm cross-compiler.

Install by copying kernel7.img on the sd card.

I'm currently working on a unicam driver to access the csi2 interface and the picam, but waiting for the open linux kernel driver to be released.
